 * Clone this repo (or open automatically in [Cloud Shell][shell_link])

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/serverless-expeditions 
    cd serverless-expeditions/terraform-serverless
    ```

  * Build the base service container:

    ```
    gcloud builds submit
    ```

    ```
    terraform init
    terraform apply
    ```
